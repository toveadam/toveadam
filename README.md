                                      Hi there, My name is Tove ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a junior developer from Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª living in Barcelona ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ who is very excited to have found my passion for developing!

My interest for programming started a couple of years ago. With the opportunity presenting itself last year, I took the leap of joining a Full-Stack JS bootcamp in Barcelona. Since then, I have done self-studies and gotten to the level now where I'm getting comfortable with the code!
I am now looking for an opportunity within Front-end development. 

Knowing that not everything as to be known by heart, but that one rather wants have the mind of understanding a task. 
So far, would say that:
What I don't know yet, I am confident I will be able to reach any expectations. 
My understanding of CSS came right from the beginning, as thoughout life I've always enjoyed the design part of things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying towards a junior developer position
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, CSS, Express...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: toveadamsson@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My obsession about the sunset or sunrise might be considered a bit over the top.
