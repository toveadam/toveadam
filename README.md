Hi there, My name is Tove ğŸ‘‹ 
I'm a software engineer from Sweden ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª living in Barcelona ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸!

My interest for programming started a couple of years ago. With the opportunity presenting itself during the start of the pandemic, I took the leap of joining a Full-Stack JS bootcamp in Barcelona. Since then, I have done a lot of studying and I've worked as a merchant integrations engineer at Bolt One-Click checkout! 

Knowing that not everything as to be known by heart, but that one has the ability and urge to understand the work. 
So far, would say that:
What I don't know yet, I am confident I will be able to reach any expectations. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Bolt 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about backend development
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: toveadamsson@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My obsession about the sunset might be considered a bit over the top.
