Hi there, My name is Tove ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a software engineer from Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª living in Barcelona ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸!

My interest for programming started a couple of years ago. With the opportunity presenting itself during the start of the pandemic, I took the leap of joining a Full-Stack JS bootcamp in Barcelona. Since then, I have built many divers projects and I have professional experience working as a Software Engineer at Bolt One-Click Checkout! 

Knowing that not everything as to be known by heart, but that one has the ability and urge to understand the work. 
So far, would say that:
What I don't know yet, I am confident I will learn in no time! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a Jr Software Developer position!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about backend development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: toveadamsson@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My obsession about the sunset might be considered a bit over the top.
